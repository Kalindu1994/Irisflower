Description:
Embarking on the fascinating journey of machine learning, I delved into the realm of classification with a hands-on project focused on identifying Iris flower types. Leveraging the power of the scikit-learn library, this project showcases my exploration into the field of machine learning and pattern recognition.

Key Features:

Dataset: Utilizing the famous Iris dataset, I employed features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width to train and test the model.

Algorithm: Implemented the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier from scikit-learn to make predictions based on the proximity of data points in feature space.

Evaluation: The project includes thorough evaluation metrics to assess the model's accuracy and effectiveness in correctly classifying Iris flower types.

Scikit-Learn: Demonstrates proficiency in utilizing the scikit-learn library for machine learning tasks.

Tech Stack:

Python Libraries: scikit-learn, Joblib
Machine Learning Algorithm: k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

Learning Experience:

This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience in implementing a machine learning algorithm for classification. Understanding the nuances of feature selection, model training, and evaluation provided valuable insights into the world of data science.
